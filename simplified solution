you wanna watch the video for K minutes   
you preload cuz your internet is slow af and it loads at A video/minute
but if you watch and load it will load at B video/minute 
the question is ? how long would you wait for the video to preload to watch without bluffering
-> that means you still watch over K minutes but combines the time you spent on preload and load while watching 
-> the math: 
A*t + B*K >= K is the minimum K minutes you'd need
-> find t
t >= K(1-B)/A
